# Interfacing with Language Models with LibreChat and Ollama

Welcome to the repository for my blog series on setting up local language models! In this repository, you'll find the necessary files and guides for setting up [LibreChat](https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat) with [Ollama](https://ollama.com) as a provider for local large language models (LLMs).

Currently, this series is focused on exploring the use of local LLMs. However, it may expand beyond that.

## Blog Series

This repository is part of an ongoing blog series where I document my journey with local language models.

My blogs can be found on [my Medium page](https://medium.com/@timothyemanik). I will continue to reference the blogs to this repo as I create them.

Stay tuned for more.
